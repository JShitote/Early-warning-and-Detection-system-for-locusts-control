# Early-warning-and-Detection-system-for-locusts-control
Inset, we propose a preventive early warning measure that utilizes the emergent technologies in ICT; Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to detect potential breeding grounds early. This will be done by identifying key parameters that define these areas such as soil moisture, vegetation cover, rainfall, wind speed and wind direction, topography/terrain, soil and air temperature and humidity. The end goal will be to inform concerned authorities early giving them the means to take effective measures before the eggs hatch and develop into adults.
